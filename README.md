# A Comparison of Metric Learning Loss Functions for End-to-End Speaker Verification

This is a repository to host the best model obtained in our paper "A Comparison of Metric Learning Loss Functions for End-to-End Speaker Verification". It contains the model trained with Additive Angular Margin loss, as well as detailed steps to reproduce the results.

If you use this in your work, please cite our paper (BibTeX coming soon!).

In order to use the model for inference or fine-tuning, you'll need to install [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) (optionally download and configure MUSAN as well).

If you want to reproduce our results, you will also need to install [pyannote's VoxCeleb database plugin](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-db-voxceleb).
